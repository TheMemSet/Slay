Reasons for not being able to place a soldier at a certain position:
 - More than one hexagon away from own territory
 - Equal or better unit on, or within one hexagon, of the hexagon being invaded. The unit has to belong to the owner of the hexagon being invaded.
 - Same case but with castle instead of unit. In that case, the attacking unit has to be Tier 1 (peasant) or Tier 2 (spearman).
 - Same case but with house instead of castle. In that case, the attacking unit has to be Tier 1 (peasant).
